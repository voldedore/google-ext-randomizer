### FAQ
###### Q: Why do you write this extension?

A: As a full-stack developer, sometime I need some random data to illustrate idea design, or to fill in a new database record in the testing phase, etc. I became tired of thinking about what name to use here or what number to input or googling for the Lorem ipsum's site. This extension was born by this main reason.

###### Q: When does next version be ready?
A: Honestly, I don't know. This extension is one of my weekend, free time, boring time... projects. So feel free to use it or modify it but I don't currently have any milestone ahead.


###### Q: I want to add more language or data to the randomly generated data?
A: Please contact to Faker.js authors. I will update this extension lib by any newer update from them.

###### Q: I want to provide other GUI languages?
A: Yes. I'm pleased to hear it and appreciate your help.
